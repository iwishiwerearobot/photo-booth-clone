# Photo Booth Clone

This arduino project imitates one of these photobooth things that people hire for weddings and parties.  
It takes the workings of a Cannon RC-1 ir remote that works with a few of the cannon eos cameras, and makes their shutters fire 4 times over a period of time when a button is pressed by the users.  
Some LEDs on there too as a count down to when the picture will be taken.
